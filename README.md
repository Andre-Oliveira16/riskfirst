- Even though it was not specified, I put a link on the top header to go back to the list of clients (to avoid having to refresh the page)

- It says on the instructions that the Item View should have the name and phone number as contact. The example image has the number and email. I assumed the correct one was the image, so I followed that

- For the nearby places, the image has '1st Floor, c/o Morleys, ...'. I wasn't completly sure but I put <number>, <street>, <city> <zip>

- For the image, it is cut, with a height of 300px. I decided this way to match closely the example and to avoid having the image taking too much space vertically (in this case it results on a cut image)

- I tried to match as much as I could with the designs. Obviously, it will look different without knowing font-family, font-size, paddings, font-color or opacity (I applied opacity to text to make it lighter. I could have applied a light colour instead)
